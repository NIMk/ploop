A simple app.bin to loop video playback
  	      by Denis Roio aka Jaromil

Website: http://nimk.nl/syncstarter

PLoop is an app.bin for the WDLXTV homebrew firmware that, once put
into an usb storage connected to the WDTV device, automatically starts
the playback of the first file in the 'video' directory of that
device.

The playback will loop indefinitely for that file and there won't ever
be any graphical interface shown: the device becomes an on/off
solution ideal for exhibition spaces and musea deploying such
technology to show videos.

** Usage and compatibility

PLoop only works on a specific hardware configuration: WD HD Live
players running B-Rad's WDLXTV firmware, something artists themselves
can afford for approx 100EUR on the consumer market.
